## Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud (Free Public URL)

Follow these step-by-step instructions to deploy your app and get a public URL that anyone can access:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Create a new GitHub repository:**
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
   - Click "New repository" 
   - Name it `r2d-reconciliation-tool`
   - Make it **Public** (required for free Streamlit Community Cloud)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Upload your files to GitHub:**
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop these files:
     - `streamlit_app.py`
     - `r2d_recon.py` 
     - `requirements.txt`
     - `README.md`
   - Add commit message: "Initial commit - R2D reconciliation tool"
   - Click "Commit changes"

### Step 2: Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud

1. **Go to Streamlit Community Cloud:**
   - Visit [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Click "Sign up with GitHub" (or sign in if you have an account)

2. **Connect your repository:**
   - Click "New app"
   - **Repository:** Select `your-username/r2d-reconciliation-tool`
   - **Branch:** `main` (default)
   - **Main file path:** `streamlit_app.py`
   - Click "Deploy!"

3. **Wait for deployment:**
   - Streamlit will install dependencies and start your app
   - This takes 2-3 minutes on first deployment
   - You'll see logs showing the deployment progress

### Step 3: Get Your Public URL

Once deployed, you'll get a URL like:
```
https://r2d-reconciliation-tool-[randomstring].streamlit.app
```

**Share this URL with your team!** Anyone can access it without installing anything.

### Step 4: Update Your App

To make changes:

1. Edit files locally
2. Upload updated files to GitHub (replace existing ones)
3. Streamlit will automatically redeploy within 1-2 minutes

### Troubleshooting

**Deployment fails?**
- Check that all files are uploaded to GitHub
- Ensure `requirements.txt` contains all dependencies
- Make sure repository is **Public**

**App shows errors?**
- Check the logs in Streamlit Community Cloud
- Verify your `r2d_recon.py` file works locally first
- Check that sheet names match your Excel files

**Need to update?**
- Just replace files in GitHub
- Streamlit auto-redeploys
- No need to manually restart

### Alternative: Local Network Sharing

If you prefer to run locally but share with your team:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.address 0.0.0.0
```

Then share your local IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8501`) with team members on the same network.

## Usage

1. **Upload Excel file** - Drag and drop your `.xlsx` file
2. **Configure settings** - Set sheet names (defaults: "Repayments to Date", "Chase") 
3. **Set date filter** - Optionally ignore debits before a certain date
4. **Run reconciliation** - Click the button and wait for processing
5. **Download results** - Get the reconciled Excel file with timestamp

## Support

- The app validates inputs and shows helpful error messages
- Check that your Excel file has the expected sheet names and column structure
- Output file includes timestamp: `Repayments_to_Date_recon-YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx`
